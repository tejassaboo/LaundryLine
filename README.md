Crowdsourcing the State of University Laundry Machines
<br>

We built a mobile application that displays the color green if the washer/dryer is empty and red if it is full by crowdsourcing information about the state of university laundry machines from students. Due to the circumstances surrounding the Covid-19 Pandemic, we pitched our app to UT Austin as a traffic control system in university laundry rooms to limit unnecessary contact.

We submitted this project to UT Austin's LEAPHACK 2020
